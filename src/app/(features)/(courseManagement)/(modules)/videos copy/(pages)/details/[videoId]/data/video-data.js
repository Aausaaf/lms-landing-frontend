    transcript:
        "Cells are the basic unit of life. All living organisms are composed of cells, and cells come from pre-existing cells. The cell theory is one of the fundamental principles of biology. Cells contain genetic material, which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, while prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. The cell membrane is a selectively permeable barrier that surrounds the cell and regulates what enters and leaves the cell.",
