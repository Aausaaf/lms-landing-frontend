    description: `
        <p>This comprehensive module covers the fundamental principles of classical mechanics and motion. Students will explore Newton's laws, kinematics, dynamics, and energy concepts through theoretical understanding and practical applications.</p>
        <p>Through interactive demonstrations, problem-solving sessions, and laboratory experiments, students will develop a deep understanding of how objects move and interact in the physical world.</p>
        <p>By the end of this module, students will be equipped with the foundational knowledge needed for advanced physics topics and real-world applications.</p>
